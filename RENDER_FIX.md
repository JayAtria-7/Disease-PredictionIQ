# 🔧 Render Deployment - Troubleshooting & Fix Guide

**Author:** Jay Prakash Kumar  
**Issue:** Model files not found during deployment

---

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

Your deployment was failing because:
1. ❌ Model `.pkl` files were excluded in `.gitignore`
2. ❌ Model files weren't pushed to GitHub
3. ❌ Render was trying to run FastAPI instead of Flask

---

## 🛠️ **FIXES APPLIED:**

### 1. Updated `.gitignore`
**Before:**
```gitignore
# Project specific
models/*.pkl     # ❌ This was blocking model files!
models/*.joblib
*.log
```

**After:**
```gitignore
# Project specific - REMOVED to allow model files in Git
# models/*.pkl   # ✅ Commented out
# models/*.joblib
*.log
```

### 2. Added Model Files to Git
```bash
git add models/*.pkl models/*.json
git commit -m "Fix: Add model files to repository"
git push
```

**Files Added:**
- ✅ `models/best_heart_disease_model.pkl` (218 KB)
- ✅ `models/scaler.pkl` (1 KB)
- ✅ `models/feature_names.pkl` (225 B)
- ✅ `models/model_metadata.json` (950 B)

### 3. Updated `render.yaml`
**Correct Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: disease-predictioniq
    runtime: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
    envVars:
      - key: FLASK_ENV
        value: production
```

## 🚀 **HOW TO DEPLOY ON RENDER NOW:**

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

If you already connected your GitHub repo to Render:
1. Render will **automatically detect** the new push
2. It will **rebuild** your app
3. Wait 3-5 minutes
4. ✅ **Deployment should succeed!**

### Option 2: Manual Trigger

1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `disease-predictioniq` service
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Wait for build to complete

### Option 3: Fresh Deployment

If you haven't deployed yet:

1. **Go to Render:** https://render.com
2. **Sign Up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Create New Web Service:**
   - Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
   - Connect repository: `Disease-PredictionIQ`
   - Click **"Connect"**

4. **Configure Service:**
   ```
   Name:           disease-predictioniq
   Region:         Oregon (US West) or closest to you
   Branch:         main
   Runtime:        Python 3
   Build Command:  pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt
   Start Command:  gunicorn app:app
   Instance Type:  Free
   ```

5. **Deploy:**
   - Click **"Create Web Service"**
   - Wait 5-10 minutes
   - ✅ **DONE!**

## 📊 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:**

- [x] Model files added to Git ✅
- [x] `.gitignore` updated ✅
- [x] `render.yaml` configured ✅
- [x] Changes pushed to GitHub ✅
- [ ] Trigger deployment on Render ⏳
- [ ] Wait for build to complete ⏳
- [ ] Test deployed app ⏳

---

## 🔍 **VERIFY MODEL FILES ARE IN GIT:**

Check your GitHub repository:
```
https://github.com/JayAtria-7/Disease-PredictionIQ/tree/main/models
```

You should see:
- ✅ best_heart_disease_model.pkl
- ✅ scaler.pkl
- ✅ feature_names.pkl
- ✅ model_metadata.json

---

## 🎯 **CORRECT RENDER CONFIGURATION:**

### Build Command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt
```

### Start Command (Choose ONE):

**Option 1 (Simple):**
```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

**Option 2 (With workers):**
```bash
gunicorn app:app --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

**Option 3 (With threads):**
```bash
gunicorn app:app --workers 2 --threads 2 --timeout 120
```

### Environment Variables:
```
FLASK_ENV = production
PYTHON_VERSION = 3.10.0
```

## 🐛 **COMMON RENDER ERRORS & SOLUTIONS:**

### Error 1: "FileNotFoundError: models/best_heart_disease_model.pkl"
**Cause:** Model files not in Git  
**Solution:** ✅ FIXED! Files are now in Git

### Error 2: "Module 'app' has no attribute 'app'"
**Cause:** Wrong start command  
**Solution:** Use `gunicorn app:app` (not `api.main:app`)

### Error 3: "Build failed: No module named 'sklearn'"
**Cause:** Missing dependency  
**Solution:** Ensure `scikit-learn` is in `requirements-deploy.txt`

### Error 4: "Port already in use"
**Cause:** Not using `$PORT` variable  
**Solution:** Use `--bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT` in start command

### Error 5: "Application startup failed"
**Cause:** Various reasons  
**Solution:** Check Render logs for specific error

---

## 📝 **HOW TO CHECK RENDER LOGS:**

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for errors (usually at the end)

### Common Log Messages:

**✅ Success:**
```
==> Deploying...
INFO: Started server process
INFO: Application startup complete
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

**❌ Failure:**
```
ERROR: FileNotFoundError: models/...
ERROR: Application startup failed
==> Exited with status 3
```

---

## 🎉 **WHAT TO EXPECT NOW:**

### Build Process (5-10 minutes):
1. ⏳ Cloning repository
2. ⏳ Installing Python packages
3. ⏳ Building Docker image
4. ⏳ Starting Gunicorn server
5. ✅ **Deployment successful!**

### Your Live URLs:
- **Main URL:** `https://disease-predictioniq.onrender.com`
- **Alternative:** `https://disease-predictioniq-[random].onrender.com`

---

## 🧪 **TEST YOUR DEPLOYED APP:**

Once deployed, test these:

1. **Home Page:**
   ```
   https://disease-predictioniq.onrender.com
   ```
   Should show your beautiful UI ✨

2. **Health Check:**
   ```
   https://disease-predictioniq.onrender.com/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

3. **Model Info:**
   ```
   https://disease-predictioniq.onrender.com/api/model-info
   ```
   Should return model metrics

4. **Make a Prediction:**
   - Go to prediction form
   - Fill in patient data
   - Click "Make Prediction"
   - Should show results ✅

---

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE TIPS:**

### 1. Free Tier Limitations:
- ⚠️ App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- ⚠️ First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds (cold start)
- ⚠️ 750 hours/month free (enough for demos)

### 2. Reduce Cold Starts:
- Keep a browser tab open (pings app every 14 minutes)
- Use external monitoring (UptimeRobot, etc.)
- Upgrade to paid tier ($7/month) for always-on

### 3. Optimize Loading:
Your app is already optimized with:
- ✅ Small model files (220KB total)
- ✅ Gunicorn with workers
- ✅ Production mode Flask

---

## 🔄 **FUTURE UPDATES:**

When you make changes:

1. **Update Code Locally**
2. **Commit & Push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your update message"
   git push
   ```
3. **Render Auto-Deploys!** 🎉
   - Automatic rebuild
   - Zero-downtime deployment
   - Rollback available if needed
