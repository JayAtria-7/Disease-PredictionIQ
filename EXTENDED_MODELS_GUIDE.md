## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

All models are evaluated using:

### Primary Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
- **Precision**: Positive predictive value TP/(TP+FP)
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: True positive rate TP/(TP+FN)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve

### Composite Score
Weighted combination for final selection:
```
Composite = 0.25×Accuracy + 0.20×Precision + 0.25×Recall + 0.15×F1 + 0.15×ROC-AUC
```

**Rationale**: 
- Recall weighted at 25% to minimize false negatives (critical in medical diagnosis)
- Accuracy weighted at 25% for overall performance
- Balanced consideration of all metrics

## 💡 Clinical Considerations

### For Heart Disease Detection:
1. **Recall (Sensitivity) is Critical**
   - Missing a disease case (False Negative) is more serious
   - High recall minimizes missed diagnoses
   - Weighted at 25% in composite score

2. **Precision Matters**
   - False positives lead to unnecessary anxiety/tests
   - Balance needed with recall
   - Weighted at 20% in composite score

3. **ROC-AUC for Threshold Selection**
   - Allows adjusting sensitivity/specificity trade-off
   - Important for different clinical scenarios
   - Screening vs. diagnostic use cases

## 📊 Interpretation Guide

### Reading the Visualizations

**1. Accuracy Bar Chart**
- Longer bar = better accuracy
- Green bars are top performers
- Look for models consistently near the right edge

**2. ROC Curves**
- Curve closer to top-left = better
- Area Under Curve (AUC) quantifies this
- AUC > 0.9 = excellent
- AUC > 0.8 = good
- AUC > 0.7 = fair

**3. Confusion Matrix**
- Top-left (TN): Correct "no disease" predictions
- Bottom-right (TP): Correct "disease" predictions
- Top-right (FP): False alarms
- Bottom-left (FN): Missed cases (most critical!)

**4. Radar Chart**
- Larger enclosed area = better overall
- Look for balanced performance across all axes
- Avoid models with any metric too low

**5. Heatmap**
- Darker green = better performance
- Look for rows that are consistently green
- Avoid models with red patches
