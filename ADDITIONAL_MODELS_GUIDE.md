## üìà Evaluation Metrics

All models are evaluated using:

1. **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
2. **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are correct
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
4. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
5. **ROC-AUC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve

---

## üèÜ Model Selection Criteria

### Weighted Scoring System

The best model is selected using a weighted overall score:

```
Overall Score = (0.35 √ó ROC-AUC) + (0.30 √ó Recall) + (0.20 √ó Accuracy) + (0.15 √ó F1-Score)
```

**Rationale for Weights:**
- **ROC-AUC (35%)**: Best indicator of discriminative ability in medical diagnosis
- **Recall (30%)**: Critical to minimize false negatives (missed disease cases)
- **Accuracy (20%)**: Overall model correctness
- **F1-Score (15%)**: Balance between precision and recall
