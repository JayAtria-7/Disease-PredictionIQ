## 🏆 Intelligent Model Selection

### Automated Best Model Selection

The notebook now automatically:

1. ✅ **Trains all 8 models** with optimized parameters
2. ✅ **Evaluates comprehensive metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
3. ✅ **Calculates weighted overall score** prioritizing medical diagnosis needs
4. ✅ **Ranks all models** from best to worst
5. ✅ **Selects best model** for deployment
6. ✅ **Saves best model** with complete metadata

### Weighted Scoring System

```
Overall Score = 35% ROC-AUC + 30% Recall + 20% Accuracy + 15% F1-Score
```

**Why these weights?**
- **ROC-AUC (35%)**: Best overall performance indicator
- **Recall (30%)**: Critical for medical diagnosis (avoid false negatives)
- **Accuracy (20%)**: General correctness
- **F1-Score (15%)**: Balance measure
